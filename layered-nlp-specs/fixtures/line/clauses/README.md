# Clauses (Line)

Description: Single-line clause boundary recognition (condition, effect, coordination, and independent clauses).

References:

Examples:
- "If payment is late, then the Company shall charge a fee."
- "The Tenant shall pay rent and the Landlord shall provide utilities."

Edge cases:
- Conditionals without explicit "then".
- Coordination without commas.

Difficulty:
- Clause boundaries overlap with punctuation and coordination keywords, which can split spans unexpectedly.
