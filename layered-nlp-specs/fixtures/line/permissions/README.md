# Permissions

Description: Allowed actions (deontic = duty/permission language), often expressed with "may", "can", or "is permitted to".

Examples:
- "The Tenant may enter for inspections."
- "The Licensee is permitted to sublicense."

Edge cases:
- "Payments may be delayed" expresses probability, not permission.

Difficulty:
- Separating permission from epistemic "may" or ability "can".
