# Prohibitions

Description: Forbidden actions (deontic = duty/permission language) using negated modals like "shall not", "must not", or "may not".

References:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition

Examples:
- "The Recipient shall not disclose Confidential Information."
- "The User must not reverse engineer the software."

Edge cases:
- "may not" can mean uncertainty rather than prohibition.

Difficulty:
- Managing negation scope and exceptions introduced by "unless" or "except".
