# Conditions

Description: Conditional clauses that modify obligation scope (scope = the text span a condition applies to).

Examples:
- "If payment is received, the Company shall deliver."
- "The Company shall deliver unless otherwise agreed."

Edge cases:
- A condition in a separate sentence should not attach.

Difficulty:
- Attaching conditions to the correct obligation and preventing scope bleed.
