# Obligations

Description: Required actions in contracts (deontic = duty/permission language), often signaled by modal verbs like "shall", "must", or "will".

Examples:
- "The Buyer shall pay within 10 days."
- "The Vendor must maintain records."

Edge cases:
- "The goods will be shipped" can be predictive rather than obligatory.

Difficulty:
- Distinguishing deontic "will" from forecasts and extracting the correct obligor in long noun phrases.
