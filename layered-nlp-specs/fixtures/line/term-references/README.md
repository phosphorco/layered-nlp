# Term References

Description: Later mentions of defined terms, a kind of coreference (linking a mention to an earlier entity).

References:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coreference

Examples:
- "The Company shall pay" after a prior "\"Company\" means ..." definition.

Edge cases:
- Partial matches like "Service Provider" vs "Provider" or case changes.

Difficulty:
- Avoiding false matches inside definitions and handling overlapping multiword terms.
