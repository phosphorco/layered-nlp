# Conflicts

Description: Contradictory obligations or permissions (deontic logic = reasoning about duties and permissions).

Examples:
- "Supplier shall deliver within 10 days" vs "Supplier shall deliver within 30 days".
- "Recipient shall not disclose" vs "Recipient may disclose to affiliates".

Edge cases:
- Conflicts hidden inside conditional scopes.

Difficulty:
- Aligning comparable obligations and distinguishing true conflicts from scope differences.
