# Clause Links (Document)

Description: Document-level relationships between clauses (parent/child, exception, coordination).

References:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clause
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_sentence

Examples:
- "If payment is late, then the Company shall charge a fee."

Edge cases:
- Exception clauses introduced by "unless".
- Coordination chains with "and" or "or".

Difficulty:
- Links are asymmetric (anchor vs target) and depend on clause boundary accuracy.
