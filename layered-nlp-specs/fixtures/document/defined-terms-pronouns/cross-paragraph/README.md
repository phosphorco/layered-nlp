# Defined Terms + Pronouns (Cross-Paragraph)

Description: Fixtures that test whether a defined term introduced in one paragraph can be the antecedent for a pronoun in a later paragraph.

Examples:
- Paragraph 1 defines "Company"; paragraph 2 uses "It" to refer to Company.

Edge cases:
- Multiple named entities defined before the pronoun.
- Pronouns that do not refer to a defined term.
- Case or article variations around the defined term.

Difficulty:
- Resolving the correct antecedent across paragraph boundaries without overmatching.
